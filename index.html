  <h1>Whatcom Deserves a Public Hospital</h1>
  <p><strong>We are worth it.</strong> Whatcom County residents deserve a hospital or a network of clinics that works more closely in tune with the people. It won't solve every problem immediately yet it is worth doing. It may be a long term project but we can build momentum.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Rome wasn't built in a day. If you plan for Whatcom's future, plan for a public hospital. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>Any implementation of a public hospital or network of clinics must be wide open for discussion and analysis. It would be a subject of democratic processes. <strong>It would be ours.</strong></p>.

  <details>
    <summary>We don't have a public hospital?</summary>
   <p>Not in Whatcom County. We have PeaceHealth which is described as a non-profit with religious affiliations that receives tax breaks to operate.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do other counties that are partly or significantly rural have public hospitals?</summary>
   <p>There are less rural serving public hospitals. But this is not a reason to not have one... it may be more of a reason to have one. More research to come.</p>
  </details>
  <!-- <details>
    <summary>Have people advocated for public hospitals in Whatcom County before?</summary>
   <p>Yes. I would love to hear more about them! Over 4 years ago it was a policy plank of a city council candidate.</p>

  <h2>Better Off Public: Quality of Care</h2>
  <p><strong>PeaceHealth comes at a cost.</strong> PeaceHealth has made cuts to services and made a push for providers to see more patients<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, PeaceHealth billed thousands of low-income patients without notifying them that they were likely eligible for financial assistance with their hospital bills<sup>2</sup>.
    A public hospital could be more responsive and funded with increased tax dollars as PeaceHealth currently benefits unfairly from reduced taxes.</p>

    <h3>Better Off Public: Freedom of Religion in Healthcare</h3>
  <p><strong>Promote freedom of expression and protections</strong> for more diversity within healthcare by providing a public hospital. This includes for those of different faiths and secular people alike than just currently promoted by PeaceHealth.</p>
