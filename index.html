  <h1>Whatcom Deserves a Public Hospital</h1>
  <p>We are worth it. Whatcom county residents deserve a hospital that works more closely in tune with the people. It won't solve every problem immediately yet it is worth doing. It may be a long term project but we can build momentum.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Rome wasn't built in a day. If you plan for Whatcom's future, plan for a public hospital. 
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Better Off Public: Quality of Care</h2>
  <p>Peacehealth comes with costs. Peacehealth has made cuts to services and a made push for providers to see more patients<sup>1</sup>. A public hospital could be more responsive and funded with increased tax dollars as Peacehealth currently benefits from reduced taxes.</p>
  <h3>Better Off Public: Freedom of Religion in Healthcare</h3>
  <p>Promote freedom of expression and protections for more diversity within healthcare by providing a public hospital. This includes for those of different faiths and secular people alike than just currently promoted by PeaceHealth: public institutions provide more protection.</p>
