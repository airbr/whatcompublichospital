  <h1>Whatcom Deserves a Public Hospital</h1>
  <p><strong>We are worth it.</strong> Whatcom County residents deserve a hospital or a network of clinics that works more closely in tune with the people. It may be a long term project but we can build momentum.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Rome wasn't built in a day. If you plan for Whatcom's future, plan for a public hospital. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>Any implementation of a public hospital or network of clinics must be wide open for discussion and analysis. It would be a subject of democratic processes. <strong>It would be ours.</strong></p>

  
  <details>
    <summary>We don't have a public hospital?</summary>
   <p>Except for the <a href="https://www.pointrobertsclinic.com/hospital-district">Point Roberts Public Hospital District</a> we do not. We primarily have PeaceHealth which is described as a private and religious institution.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What kind of hospital do you mean?</summary>
    <p>More specifically a Public Hospital District. This could take many forms in practice. To the website author it just makes sense to call the district a hospital for conversation and this website.</p>
    <p>An article <a href="https://salish-current.org/2023/07/07/what-do-you-know-about-public-hospital-districts/">"What do you know about Public Hospital Districts?" by the Salish Current explains more.</a></p>

  <h2>Better Off Public: Quality of Care</h2>
  <p><strong>PeaceHealth comes at a cost.</strong> PeaceHealth has made cuts to services and made a push for providers to see more patients<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2023/oct/02/frustration-with-peacehealth-has-become-a-political-issue/">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Additionally, PeaceHealth billed thousands of low-income patients without notifying them that they were likely eligible for financial assistance with their hospital bills<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-peacehealth-will-return-134-million-patients-who-should-have">2</a></sup>.</p>
  <p> A public hospital could be more responsive and would be much more connected to community.<strong> We should be prepared for a public future</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Better Off Public: Freedom of Religion in Healthcare</h3>
  <p><strong>Promote freedom of expression and protections</strong> for more diversity within healthcare by providing a public hospital or network of clinics. This includes for those of different faiths and secular people alike than just currently promoted by Saint Josephs Hospital as the only one in the county.</p>

  <h3>We could be more. For now, join us in learning and building capacity!</h3>

  <p>
    Some day organically this website could become in support of a policy or proposal. For right now it is just a website about our support for a public hospital in Whatcom County in the long term. We have an early stage <a href="/data.html">ongoing data research project</a> you could be a part of and will post updates via our newsletter.
