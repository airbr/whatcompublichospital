  <h1>Whatcom Deserves a Public Hospital</h1>
  <p><strong>We are worth it.</strong> Whatcom County residents deserve a hospital or a network of clinics that works more closely in tune with the people. It won't solve every problem immediately yet it is worth doing. It may be a long term project but we can build momentum.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Rome wasn't built in a day. If you plan for Whatcom's future, plan for a public hospital. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>Any implementation of a public hospital or network of clinics must be wide open for discussion and analysis. It would be a subject of democratic processes. <strong>It would be ours.</strong></p>.

    <summary>We don't have a public hospital?</summary>
   <p>Except for the <a href="https://www.pointrobertsclinic.com/hospital-district">Point Roberts Public Hospital District</a> we do not. We primarily have PeaceHealth which is described as a non-profit with religious affiliations that receives tax breaks to operate.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What kind of hospital do you mean?</summary>
    <p>More specifically a Public Hospital District. This could take many forms in practice. To the website author it just makes sense to call the district a hospital for conversation and this website.</p>
    <p>An article <a href="https://salish-current.org/2023/07/07/what-do-you-know-about-public-hospital-districts/">"What do you know about Public Hospital Districts?" by the Salish Current explains more.</a></p>

    <summary>Who else has advocated for a Public Hospital in Whatcom County?</summary>
   <p><a href="https://www.whatcomdemocrats.org/platform-and-resolutions">The Whatcom Democrats include it as one item in their platform</a></p>
   <p><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/whatcom-county-deserves-a-public-hospital/">Whatcom DSA has also advocated for a public hospital in the past</a></p>

  <h2>Better Off Public: Quality of Care</h2>
  <p><strong>PeaceHealth comes at a cost.</strong> PeaceHealth has made cuts to services and made a push for providers to see more patients<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2023/oct/02/frustration-with-peacehealth-has-become-a-political-issue/">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Additionally, PeaceHealth billed thousands of low-income patients without notifying them that they were likely eligible for financial assistance with their hospital bills<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-peacehealth-will-return-134-million-patients-who-should-have">2</a></sup>.</p>
  <p> A public hospital could be more responsive and would be much more connected to community.<strong> We should be prepared for a public future</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Better Off Public: Freedom of Religion in Healthcare</h3>
  <p><strong>Promote freedom of expression and protections</strong> for more diversity within healthcare by providing a public hospital or network of clinics. This includes for those of different faiths and secular people alike than just currently promoted by PeaceHealth.</p>
  
  <!-- <h3>Better Off Public: Career advancement and retention</h3>
  <p><strong></strong> .</p> -->

  <h3>This is just a website. It could be more.</h3>

  <p>
    Some day organically this website could become in support of a policy or proposal. For right now it is just a website about my support for a public hospital in Whatcom County in the long term.
